# Human-Computer Interaction: Norman's 7 Design Principles

This project is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) website built with Vue 3 that visually and interactively demonstrates Norman's 7 Design Principles. These principles are essential guidelines for designing user-friendly interfaces and improving the interaction between humans and computers.

## Project Overview

The website provides a practical and interactive way to explore Norman's 7 design principles, helping users understand the importance of usability and intuitive design. Each principle is illustrated with examples, interactive elements, and explanations that showcase how it applies to real-world design scenarios.

## Norman's 7 Design Principles:

- Simplicity: Keeping the design simple and uncluttered.
- Consistency: Maintaining a consistent visual language and user experience.
- Feedback: Providing clear and timely feedback to users.
- Conceptual Model: Creating a clear and logical conceptual model of the system.
- Affordance: Offering intuitive and natural ways to interact with the system.
- Signifiers: Using visual cues and symbols to convey meaning.
- Mappings: Creating a clear and logical mapping between the user interface and the underlying system.
- Constraints: Ensuring that the system is usable and accessible to all users.

## Features
